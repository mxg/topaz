Hierarchy
=========

Demonstration of the hierarchy or composition pattern.  Data is stored
hierarchically, in a tree, and can be accessed with tree searches or
traversals.

Each node in the tree has one parent, except for the root node which
has no parents.  Each node has zero or more children. Nodes with no
children are leaf nodes.  Nodes with one or more children are internal
nodes.
