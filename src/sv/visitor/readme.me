Visitor
=======

The visitor pattern is a means to traverse all of the elements in a
container data structure.  Whether the container is a list, or a tree,
or something else, each element is visited in some order.  A visit()
function is applied to each element, which can do antying to or with
the element.

In this example each element of a tree is printed.
