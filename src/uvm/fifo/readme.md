FIFO
====

This example illustrates the essential elements of a UVM testbench
based on the canonical testbench pattern.

The DUT is a simple `FIFO` which provides the opportunity to
demonstrate all of the key elements of a UVM testbench with a
minimally complex design.  The example includes a complete driver,
monitor, agent, scoreboard, and sequences.  The organization of the
testbench implements the canonical testbench pattern.
