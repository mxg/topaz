Regex Toy
=========

A simple framework for experimenting with regular expressions.  In the
module `top` provide a list of strings and a regular expression.  The
function `regex_toy()` will list which strings in the list, if any,
match the regular expression.  It uses the UVM regular expression
matching facility to do the matching.  A good way to enhance your
understanding of regular expressions is to try matching different
regular expressions against different sets of strings to see if your
predictions as to which string match are correct.
