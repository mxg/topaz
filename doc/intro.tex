The Topaz library is a collection of SystemVerilog and UVM examples.
The library is a companion to the book \emph{Patterns and Idioms in
SystemVerilog and UVM} by Mark Glasser.  The examples demonstrate
various implementations of design patterns and coding idioms that are
useful in building testbenches.

This document provides a brief description of each example.
